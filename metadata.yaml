description: The gripping novel Tess of the Storm Country was a very popular bestseller
  that inspired no fewer than four film versions. The story centers on Tess Skinner,
  a beautiful but impoverished young woman from the wrong side of the tracks. The
  book offers a gritty look at poverty and social mores in turn-of-the-twentieth-century
  America, but this note of realism is nicely balanced out by the against-all-odds
  romance that blossoms between Tess and the man of her dreams.
